# Perfume Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is a data analysis and clustering exploration of a perfume sales dataset. The goal was to gain insights into customer behavior, identify patterns, and segment customers based on their age and purchase quantity. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), K-Means clustering, visualization, and cluster validation.

## Project Structure

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis code.
- `perfume_sales_dataset.csv`: Raw dataset containing perfume sales data.

## Data Preprocessing

- Loaded and explored the raw dataset.
- Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and formatting issues.
- Selected relevant features for analysis: 'Customer Age' and 'Quantity'.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted EDA to understand data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- Visualized data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## K-Means Clustering

- Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers based on age and purchase quantity.

## Visualizations

- Created scatter plots to visualize customer segments in the age-quantity space.
- Evaluated cluster validation metrics including Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.

## Cluster Analysis

- Analyzed cluster characteristics and interpreted customer segments.
- Performed ANOVA tests to assess significant differences in purchase quantity among clusters.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis and clustering techniques can provide insights into customer behavior and segment customers based on their characteristics. The analysis enables businesses to tailor marketing strategies and services to different customer segments effectively.
